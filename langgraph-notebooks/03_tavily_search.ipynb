As a low-level framework, LangGraph lets you control how agents interact with each other, which tools to use, and how information flows within the application. LangGraph uses this graph concept to organize AI agents and their interactions. We can then build our Graph by passing our State to the StateGraph class so that all graph nodes communicate by reading and writing to the shared state. A LangGraph node takes the state of the graph as a parameter and returns an updated state after it is executed. Great, now we'll wrap these mock methods and expose them as tools which will become part of the Tools node within our LangGraph graph.\",\n",
